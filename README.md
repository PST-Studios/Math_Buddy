# Math_Buddy
A math program that allows for the user to practice simple to complex problems for addition, subtraction, or multiplication.

This program is one that I find myself using quite often, just because of how useful it is for keeping myself quick on my math.  Math has never been my greatest subject, but with this program, I have no problem logging a good 20 minutes a day learning.

You just set your settings and answer the question.  Right answers get a ding.  Wrong answers get a buzzer.

This program was not meant for public release so any issues you encounter are there to stay.  If you want to make any changes to the code or the program, feel free.  I am not responsible for anything regarding this program or the code.  Feel free to scan the code and the files.  If you have any questions, I'll do my best to help you out.
